# Week 2

## Files in this directory

 - ```repeat_adder.py``` - slightly corrected version of the repeat_adder.py from the main repository for this course.

 - ```time_print.py```, ```time_print.c``` - do the same as the same files as in the main repository. Take an input integer and time how long it takes to print all non-negative integers lower than the input value to the console. They also append the input value and the time taken to run the file to ```./data/python_time_print_results.txt``` or ```./data/c_time_print_results.txt``` as the case my be.

 - ```time_save.py```, ```time_save.c``` - take an input integer and time how long it takes to open a new file, write all non-negative integers lower than the input value to the file and then save the file. This file is ```./data/python_time_out.txt``` or ```./data/c_time_out.txt```. They also append the input value and the time taken to run the file to ```./data/python_time_save_results.txt``` or ```./data/c_time_save_results.txt``` as the case my be.

 - ```time_read.py```, ```time_read.c``` - files to time how long it takes to open a file, read its contents and then close the files. The file that is opened is the file created by the corresponding ```time_save.*``` file. They also append the file size and the time taken to run the file to ```./data/python_time_read_results.txt``` or ```./data/c_time_read_results.txt``` as the case my be.

 - ```run_c.sh``` and ```run_python.sh``` - shell scripts to repeatedly run all three of the files in each language for a number of different inputs. Easily editable, but currently they use 1, 2, 3, .., 9, 10, 20, 30, .., 90, 100, .., 9e8, 1e9 as inputs for the python or c programs. Then delete the corresponding ```./data/python_time_out.txt``` or ```./data/c_time_out.txt``` as these files can be quite large and are not needed once the scripts have been run.

 - ```plotting.py``` - takes the data generated by the python and C programs and generates plots of the data.

All ```time_*.py``` and C files also print the time taken to the console (this of course is not counted in the timing).

Also, for all ```time_*.py``` and C files the time taken to open and append to the ```*_results.txt``` file is not included.

## Running the files

The python and C files should be run from a directory which contains a sub-directory named ```data```. The python files don't necessarily have to be in this directory however.

The C files should be compiled to a directory called ```bin```.

```run_c.sh``` and ```run_python.sh``` should be run in the directory which contains the data directory.

File structure for running the python or C files in isolation:
- ```directory_in_which_they_are_run/```
	- ```data/```

File structure for running the bash files:
- ```directory_in_which_they_are_run/```
	- ```data/```
	- ```bin/```
	- ```HPQC/```
		- ```week2/```

I would also recommend running the ```.sh``` files in ```tmux``` as they can take a while to run.

When running ```plotting.py``` all data files must be present or an error will occur.


## Results

The plots are shown below, grouped by language and by task. There are also plots of all 6 tasks together. Each plot is given in linear and log-log scale.

[Note: for any plot including the time taken to save the data as well as the other tasks the size of the input file is displayed on the top x-axis, however in the linear scale the scale of 1e10 appears near the lower x-axis, I can't figure out how to fix this, but if I do I will remove this note and update the corresponding images.]
