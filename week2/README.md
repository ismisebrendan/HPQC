# Week 2

The work done in week 2.
---

repeat_adder.py - slightly corrected version of the repeat_adder.py from the main repository for this course.

time_print.py, time_print.c - the same files as in the main repository, copied here so I could edit them to make the time_save files.

time_save.py, time_save.c - files to time how long it takes to open a file, write a sequence of numbers to them and then close the files.
