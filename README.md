# HPQC


A repository for all the work done in the High Performance and Quantum Computing module.


The important stuff for each week's work is given in the corresponding folder.

## File structure and running the files

Unless otherwise stated it should be assumed that within the folders for each week (```weekX```) there should be a ```data/``` and ```bin/``` folder (that have been ignored by git). All C and MPI files should be compiled to the ```bin/``` folder. All files should be run for the main ```weekX``` folder unless otherwise stated.
